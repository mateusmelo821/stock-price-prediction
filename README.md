# stock-price-prediction

This is a data science project that made use of dataset containing information about the Tesla stock prices through time. The data was stored in a GCP BigQuery table. In this project, I have made use of tools like Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy and sklearn), Jupyter notebooks, exploratory data analysis, machine learning and regression algorithms, git and github pages. The full report can be accessed [here](https://mateusmelo821.github.io/stock-price-prediction/).
